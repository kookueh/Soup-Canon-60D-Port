Soup Film
=========

Film looks for every new shot, developed in the camera.

After each frame, Soup Film runs the picture through the selected film
stock and writes FLM_nnnn.JPG next to it in the DCIM folder, at 2592x1728
(the camera's own S1 size, so it shows in playback). The original CR2 or
JPG is never modified.

Shoot RAW or RAW+JPEG and it uses the full-size JPEG Canon embeds in the
CR2. Shoot JPEG only and it uses the camera JPEG.

Stocks live in ML/FILM on the card (INDEX.TXT plus .fs files), and can be
edited with the Soup Stocks editor. Choice and on/off are kept in ML/SE.CFG.

Beta. A port of Soup Engine (jiijii0) via the 50D integration (rebelt2i).
